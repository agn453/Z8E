Z8E is a CP/M-hosted screen-oriented assembly-language debugger for the Z80
and Z180 (HD64180) processors.  It can take advantage of a second monitor if
one is available to separate the debugging dialogue from the console I/O of
the application program being analysed.

These notes apply to version 4.1 of Z8E.

Z8E version 4.1
===============

Version 4.1 introduces a minor optimisation to Z8E which applies when the
secondary terminal is the same as the primary.  That makes it possible for
both terminals to share code and data and in so doing reduces the amount of
memory used by the debugger itself.

Adaptation of Z8E to various hardware and software environments has been
substantially reworked.  Versions prior to 4.0 allowed binary patching for
terminal configuration but that was abandoned on the premise that anyone
debugging at the assembly language level is likely to have the ability to
write or modify an assembly language source file to tailor Z8E to his needs.

The source code in 4.0 was a bit of a mess and hard to modify.  Just figuring
out what needed to be done was difficult.  That issue has been addressed.
Small external source files containing the environment-specific code and data
are included during assembly.  It is just a matter of copying two or three
suitably-tailored source files to have the expected names and then assembling
Z8E from the source code.

The behaviour of Z8E at the command level was a bit inconsistent, particularly
in respect to repeating the same command and in recognising command changes.
An attempt has been made to clean that up.

The Z8E manual has been updated.

Some CP/M Plus submit files are supplied, each tailored to a different
assembler toolset

	BUILDM.SUB	Microsoft M80/L80
	BUILDZ.SUB	SLR's Z80ASM or equivalent
	BUILDC.SUB	Cromemco CDOS Z80 Macro Assembler

These srcipts generate all four versions of Z8E:

	18E1.COM	Z180 support, one terminal
	18E2.COM	Z180 support, two terminals
	Z8E1.COM	Z80, one terminal ("standard" version)
	Z8E2.COM	Z80, two terminals

To use any of the scripts the requirements for assembling Z8E must be met.
The Z8E manual describes the build process.  These scripts merely automate it.
