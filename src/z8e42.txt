Z8E is a CP/M-hosted screen-oriented assembly-language debugger for the Z80
and Z180 (HD64180) processors. It can take advantage of a second monitor if
one is available to separate the debugging dialogue from the console I/O of
the application program being analysed.

These notes apply to version 4.2 of Z8E.

Z8E version 4.2
===============

Version 4.2 fixes a bug in the symbol table load routine: if the file
ended exactly at a record boundary, a "Symbol Table Not Found" error was
displayed and no symbols were loaded.

In addition, clearing of the screen is now done by sending the appropriate
control sequences to the terminal. The old method of clearing the screen
with a string of line-feeds left garbage on the screen in certain cases.
